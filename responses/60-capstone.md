Your pipeline is looking great, @{{ user.username }}! It's time to put it through its paces and experience the benefits of a well-plumbed pipeline. The larger your pipeline becomes, the more useful are the tools you've learned in this course.

In this issue you will:

* Expand the pipeline to include all of the U.S. states and some territories
* Learn one more **scipiper** tool, the `loop_tasks()` function
* Modify the pipeline to describe temperature sites instead of discharge sites
