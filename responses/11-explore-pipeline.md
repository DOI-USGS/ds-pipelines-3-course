### :keyboard: Explore the starter pipeline

Without modifying any code, start by inspecting and running the existing data pipeline.

- [ ] Open up *remake.yml* and read through - can you guess what will happen when you build the pipeline?
- [ ] Build all targets in the pipeline.
- [ ] Check out the contents of `oldest_active_sites`.

:bulb: Refresher hints:

* To build a pipeline, run `library(scipiper)` and then `scmake()`.
* To assign an R-object pipeline target to your local environment, run `mytarget <- scmake('mytarget')`. 

When you're satisfied that you understand the current pipeline, include the value of `oldest_active_sites$site_no` and the image from *site_map.png* in a comment on this issue.
