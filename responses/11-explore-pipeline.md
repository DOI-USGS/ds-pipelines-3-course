Without modifying any code, start by inspecting and running the existing data pipeline.

### :keyboard: Explore the starter pipeline

- [ ] Open up *remake.yml* and read through - can you guess what will happen when you build the pipeline?
- [ ] Build all targets in the pipeline.
- [ ] Check out the contents of `oldest_active_sites`.

Refresher hints:

* To build a pipeline, run `library(scipiper)` and then `scmake()`.
* To assign an R-object pipeline target to your local environment, run `mytarget <- scmake('mytarget')`. 

<hr><h3 align="center">When you're satisfied that you understand the current pipeline, include the value of oldest_active_sites site_no and the image from site_map.png in a comment on this issue.</h3>
