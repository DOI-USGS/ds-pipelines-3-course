Awesome, time for your first code changes :pencil:.

### :keyboard: Apply a downloading function to each state

Write three **scipiper** targets in *remake.yml* to apply `get_sites_data()` to each state in `states`. The targets should be named `wi_data`, `mn_data`, and `mi_data`.

Hint: the `get_sites_data()` function already exists and shouldn't need modification. You can find it by browsing the repo or by hitting **Ctrl-.** in RStudio and then searching for "get_sites_data".

<hr><h3 align="center">Open a PR to merge the "three-states" branch into "master" - I'll respond in that PR.</h3>
