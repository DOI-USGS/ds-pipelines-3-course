Great, here we go! You'll be revising files in this repository shortly. To follow our team's standard git workflow, you should first clone this training repository to your local machine so that you can make file changes and commits there. 

### :keyboard: Set up your local repository

Open a git bash shell (Windows) or a terminal window (Mac) and change (`cd`) into the directory you work in for projects in R (for me, this is `~/Documents/Code`). There, clone the repository and set your working directory to the new project folder that was created:
```
git clone git@github.com:{{ user.username }}/{{ repo }}.git
cd {{ repo }}
```

<hr><h3 align="center">When you're set up locally, close this issue and head back to the [Issues]({{ repoUrl }}/issues) page for your next assignment.</h3>
